# Trusted Web White Paper Ver1.0  
## Executive Summary  
Trusted Web Promotion Council  

## 1\. Background (Main text 1. to 2.)

-   Amid of digitalization, various pain points have arisen for data reliability concerns on the Internet/Web, such as fake news, infringement of privacy, a single point of failure risk associated with a winner-takes-all situation, and siloed industrial data with less utilization.

-   When the society transform to "Digital Society," current communication protocol on the Internet/Web, have insufficient capability or protocol creating trust relationship and safeness in the digital society. Therefore we must think how to rebuild the Trust on the Internet/Web.

## 2\. Goal of Trusted Web (Main text 3. to 5.)

-   In the current system (on the Internet/Web), only small portion of facts associated with data exchange can be verified, so that we are forced to rely on platform operators without checking the facts. We also depend on using identifier mechanism provided by platform operators that link to our data.

-   It is necessary to increase the level of trust (the degree to which the other party behaves as expected) by introducing the mechanism of data control and consensus building, as well as by expanding the verifiability, without relying on a specific service.

-   We aim to overlay the trust framework on the current Internet (“Overlay approach”) and to enable various parties to create new value. This is our goal that we call as ‘Trusted Web’.

-   Trusted Web allow users to have access control of the data (Identifier management function), to verify trust of other parties and data including third parties reviews (Trustable Communication), to build consensus on conditions in data exchange dynamically reflecting the intentions of both parties (Dynamic Consent function), and to verify the process and fulfillment of the consensus (Trace function). Multi-stakeholder based governance will support these functions.

-   We expect that, by making reliable data more valuable and by facilitating data sharing without even knowing each other, it will lead to generate more economic value.

## 3\. Road map (Main text 6.) 

-   The objective of this "Discussion paper" is to provide the starting point to generate discussion and collaboration with various global communities. The goal of the Trusted Web is to implement the functions above mentioned in collaboration with relevant stakeholders across on the Internet/Web by 2030.
